# LyX macros

This repository contains different macros to use with [LyX](www.lyx.org); namely:
1. `macros_dq.lyx` contains different macros complying with the notation found in [Adorno (2017)](#[1]).
2. `macros_optimization` contains macros helping type optimization problems, such as the ones used by [Marinho and Adorno (2022)](#[2]).
